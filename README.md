# My own website!

One of the main things I wanted to accomplish in this project was the "full page" scroll effect, and well... it was a more significant challenge than I expected! The difficult part wasn't the effect but ensuring it worked smoothly across different browsers, devices, input methods, etc. I almost gave up the idea a couple of times but in the end, I pushed through, managed to work around the problems, and make something I'm really proud of!
